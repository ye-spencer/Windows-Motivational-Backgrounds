A project is never truly done, here are some future steps that I, or anyone else, can take to improve this project

# New Features
 + Create a method for deleting quotes
 + Find way of automatically installing into Windows Time Scheduler
 + Have custom windows backgrounds, or even randomly combine quotes and backgrounds
 + Have an option for scraping motivation quotes from the internet, or take some from a central database

# Optimization
 + Store quotes without saving the entire background to be more space efficient
 + Use args parsing for better argument handling
